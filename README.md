This is a project I had to create a site utilizing and practicing what was learnt about working with postgreSQL with a website. 
The website shows a number of books that I would like to read, the title, reason for wanting to read, the book cover caught from using Open Library Covers API,
the rating/how interested I am in reading it and then the date and time it was added. I also added a form below for anyone who visits to suggest a book and it would be added to the database
and displayed for me to see. 
The website also has a filter button where the user can change the order of how the books are displayed.
The website uses the ISBN to find the book cover using Open Library Covers API and returns it.
